We present a study into the complementary nature of mediation analysis
and our recently developed pleiotropy test for multiparental populations.
While our test and mediation analysis ask distinct scientific questions,
we argue that our pleiotropy test is especially useful when mediation analysis
fails to identify an intermediate.
Our study uses publicly available genome-wide SNP and gene expression data
from 378 Diversity Outbred mice. Keller et al. (2018) identified five expression
trait hotspots in pancreatic islet cells. 
147 nonlocal expression traits mapped to a 4-Mb
expression trait hotspot on Chromosome 2. Keller et al. (2018) presented evidence 
for mediation by Hnf4a expression levels of 88 of 147 traits.

We share our custom R code in a publicly accessible Github repository. We also 
share our pleiotropy test software as a R package on Github.
We invite users to explore our Github repositories via Binder.
